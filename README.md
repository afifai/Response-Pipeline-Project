# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

This project is part of the Data Engineering section of the Data Science Nanodegree program by Udacity. The goal of this project is to build a pipeline that processes and analyzes disaster response messages. The pipeline includes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean and store the data in a database, as well as an ML (Machine Learning) process to train a classifier for categorizing the messages. The resulting model is then deployed in a web application for users to interact with.

## Project Overview

During and after a disaster, various types of messages are generated through social media, news outlets, and other sources. These messages contain crucial information about the affected areas, people in need, available resources, and other related topics. However, manually sorting and categorizing these messages can be a time-consuming and challenging task for emergency response organizations.

The Disaster Response Pipeline project aims to address this challenge by providing an automated system that can effectively categorize incoming disaster-related messages. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the application classifies messages into relevant categories, such as medical assistance, food, water, shelter, infrastructure, and more.

## Application Benefits

The deployment of this application brings several benefits to the community and organizations involved in disaster response efforts:

1. **Quick Message Classification:** The application allows for the rapid categorization of incoming messages, enabling emergency response teams to quickly identify the most critical areas and allocate appropriate resources.

2. **Resource Optimization:** By automatically classifying messages, the application helps optimize the allocation of resources. Emergency response organizations can efficiently prioritize and address specific needs based on the categories identified in the messages.

3. **Enhanced Decision-making:** The categorized data and insights generated by the application can aid decision-making processes at different levels. It provides a comprehensive overview of the types of assistance required, helping organizations strategize and plan their response effectively.

4. **Efficient Information Sharing:** The web application interface allows authorized users to access the categorized messages, facilitating effective information sharing and collaboration among different response teams and stakeholders.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following main files:

1. `data`: This directory contains the data processing scripts and the raw data files:

   - `process_data.py`: ETL script to clean and store the data in a SQLite database.
   - `disaster_messages.csv`: CSV file containing the disaster response messages.
   - `disaster_categories.csv`: CSV file containing the categories associated with each message.

2. `models`: This directory contains the machine learning script and the saved model file:

   - `train_classifier.py`: ML script to train a classifier using the cleaned data and save the model as a pickle file.
   - `classifier.pkl`: Saved model file containing the trained classifier.

3. `app`: This directory contains the web application files for visualizing the results:
   - `run.py`: Python script to run the web application.
   - `templates`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web pages.

## Instructions

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model:

   - To run the ETL pipeline that cleans the data and stores it in a database:
     `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`

   - To run the ML pipeline that trains the classifier and saves it:
     `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to the `app` directory:

   ```
   cd app
   ```

3. Run the web app:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```
